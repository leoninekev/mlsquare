MLSquare is an open source developer-friendly Python library, designed to make use of Deep Learning for Machine Learning developers.


================
Getting Started!
================

Setting up ``mlsquare`` is simple and easy

    1. Create a Virtual Environment

    .. code-block:: bash

        virtualenv ~/.venv
        source ~/.venv/bin/activate

    2. Install ``mlsquare`` package

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install mlsquare

    3. Import ``dope`` function from ``mlsquare`` and pass the ``sklearn`` model object

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from mlsquare.imly import dope
        >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

        >>> model = LinearRegression()
        >>> m = dope(model)

        >>> # All sklearn operations can be performed on m, except that the underlying implementation uses DNN
        >>> m.fit(x_train, y_train)
        >>> m.score(x_test, y_test)
